    <h2>Aldair Payehuanca</h2>
    
    <p>Hello everyone... </p>
        <p>I'm Aldair Payehuanca, My friends call me Ali, I'm from Peru, I live in the south of Peru in a city called Arequipa.</p>
        <p>I served a mission in Rosario Argentina, helping others to receive the same gospel that I learned from other missionaries, who visited my home in my childhood. 
            I have been 18 years old as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
            the gospel helps me change and improve every day.</p>
            <p>Iam currently the president of the Sunday school in my neighborhood, one of the things I like to do is share the scriptures with others, also draw and paint.</p>
            <p>I enjoy learning new things especially about technology i want to get a degree about applied technology. I am taking this course because I like to program and develop new tools to help others
                I hope we can learn together and get to know each other better through this course.</p>
