Advances in medicine have made it possible for doctors to cure many diseases and save many lives. Today, many medications are obtained from a wide variety of sources. Many of which come from substances found in nature, such as plants. Other medicines are made in laboratories, mixing a series of chemical substances. In almost all cases, these medicines require careful planning in terms of distribution and care, since certain medicines require a special environment to maintain their medical qualities, on the other hand, certain medicines are not very demanding in terms of distribution and care. The distribution of medicines and pharmaceutical products consists of obtaining, preserving and delivering these products to the final customer; Many agents are involved in this process, starting with a laboratory and ending with the end customer. These agents, by working in harmony, allow this chain to fulfill its objective.
